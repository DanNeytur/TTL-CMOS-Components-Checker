## Description

The purpose of this project was to indentify and check TTL/CMOS components (up to 20 pins) using FPGA controler.

The user has a few ways to inteface with the project.
* ZIF IC socket 20 pins- for quick and easy instert and pulling of tested components.
* 4 push-buttons on development board- for the user to interact with the project.
* LCD display- showing the options the user can pick, testing/indentifying results.
* Sound module APR9600 + speaker- sounds prerecorded voice messages according to the state of the system.
* Red & Green LEDs- lights according to testing/indentifying results
